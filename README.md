Face detection
⚫ Use the GUI for training
⚫ Use any face related datasets for training your Haar
cascade classifier
⚫ Also, include your team’s self-made dataset in the training 
data alongside public dataset 
⚫ Team’s self-made dataset MUST contain all your team 
members faces in different orientations, scales and 
illumination conditions
⚫ Finally, use the trained model (cascade classifier for testing 
and evaluation)
